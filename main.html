            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Hello there! My name is Petri Kilpeläinen and this website works as my portfolio. I am a 20 year old man that has studied programming for 5 years at this point.</p>
            <p>I was born in Tornio and went through school there before finishing the vocational college Lappia with a information and communication technology degree. After which i moved to oulu to get an engineering degree in the same subject from OAMK.</p>
            <p>I have used many programming languages throughout the years. In vocational college I started with C# using it for video games. When I came to OAMK we learned C and C++. After half a year in school I had to participate in our military as a conscript. In the army I joined the special forces that manage and create virtual simulation training. In the army I learned SQF and started learning python which I continued even after army. Continuing with school I have come to learn Java.</p>
